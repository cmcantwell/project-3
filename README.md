Covid-19 Public Information Website

This project is meant to provide general information on the Covid-19 virus, including a brief history of the virus, vaccination suggestions, a visual comparison of vaccination numbers, and the concentration of Covid-19 virus in wastewater samples. 

Our webpage is meant to have 4 pages: a home page with general information, an interactive map showing total vaccines administered by state, a bar graph of vaccinations by state, and a bar graph of vaccines administered by age.
